# Phishing-Detection-Using-ML
Problem Statement:

With the ever-evolving tactics of cybercriminals, traditional methods of combating phishing can struggle to keep pace. Machine Learning offers a powerful approach to identify patterns in website features that distinguish phishing sites from legitimate ones. This project aims to develop a robust ML model for accurate phishing detection.

Methodology:

Data Collection:

A well-curated dataset of labeled URLs (phishing and legitimate) will be obtained from reputable sources like UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the ML model.
Feature Engineering:

Key features that differentiate phishing and legitimate websites will be extracted from the URLs. These features may include:
Address Bar Features: Length of URL, presence of subdomains, special characters, etc.
Domain Features: Domain age, presence of hyphens, country-code Top-Level Domains (ccTLDs), etc.
Content Features: Presence of suspicious keywords, HTML/JavaScript elements associated with phishing, etc.
Model Selection and Training:

A variety of supervised machine learning algorithms will be considered and evaluated based on their performance on the dataset. Some potential candidates include:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
XGBoost
Neural Networks
Model Evaluation:

The trained models will be rigorously assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve. This evaluation helps determine the model's effectiveness in classifying phishing URLs.
Deployment (Optional):

Depending on your project's scope, you may explore integrating the trained model into a web application or browser extension for real-time phishing detection.
Expected Outcomes:

A well-trained ML model that achieves high accuracy in classifying phishing and legitimate URLs.
Improved awareness of phishing tactics and how ML can enhance online security.
Potential for further development and deployment into practical applications.
